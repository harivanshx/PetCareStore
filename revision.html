            This is a revision of the PetStoree project. The project was initially created with a single page, index.html, and the content was divided into sections using the <section> tag. Each section had a specific purpose, such as displaying a hero image, cards with information, and a footer with contact details.    
                </section>
                
                
           
                
                <section>
                    <p>
                        The project was then revised to include separate HTML files for each section, such as home.html, about.html, contact.html, and services.html. These files were linked together using the <a> tag with the href attribute pointing to the respective file path. This allowed for better organization of the project and easier navigation between sections.</a>
